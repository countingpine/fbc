**<u>FreeBASIC</u>**
	I regularly use and recommend FreeBASIC to anyone needing a language that provides ease-of-use, low development times, portability and support for a variety of programming paradigms. I log on occasionally at the official FreeBASIC site [www.freebasic.net] and read about what's new with FreeBASIC and its great community at the forums there [www.freebasic.net/forum].
